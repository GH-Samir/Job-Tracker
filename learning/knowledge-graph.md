## why-javascript
- status: introduced
- depends-on: none
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Explained that one language for frontend+backend halves the syntax load; noted large support community and SE-job relevance.

## typescript
- status: introduced
- depends-on: why-javascript
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: —
- evidence: Told what it is (JavaScript + type labels on data); parked as a later upgrade.

## why-react
- status: introduced
- depends-on: why-javascript
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Weighed HTML/CSS-first vs React; chose React given prior HTML/CSS experience and job-relevance.

## why-node-express
- status: introduced
- depends-on: why-javascript
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Explained Node runs JS outside the browser; Express adds conventions/helpers for smooth server interactions.

## why-relational-database
- status: introduced
- depends-on: database
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Explained consistent/structured data fits tables (one row per entry); NoSQL is for unpredictable data.

## why-deployment-complex
- status: introduced
- depends-on: deployment
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Identified the database as part of it; corrected toward three running, connected services (frontend, backend, database) needing to be wired together.

## git-commit
- status: practicing
- depends-on: none
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Ran git init/add/commit unaided. Correctly named the "untracked files" heading before seeing it. Predicted the staged heading as "tracked files" (actual: "Changes to be committed") — corrected toward staging being a queue of changes, not a file status. Correctly predicted `git log --oneline` would print one line beginning with the commit hash.

## gitignore
- status: practicing
- depends-on: git-commit
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Correctly said node_modules should not be committed, but reasoned "not all the packages are needed" — corrected toward the real rule: they're all needed, but rebuildable from package.json, and git tracks what you author, not what a machine generates. Then correctly described .gitignore's behaviour ("it will list all of them except the ones in gitignore") and ballparked the surviving file count at 9 (actual 16) by reasoning from what Vite generates.

## local-environment
- status: practicing
- depends-on: none
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Scaffolded into the wrong folder (terminal was in learning/); ran `pwd` and correctly read off the cause — "client is now under job tracker, not learning" after fixing with `mv client ..`. Correctly predicted moving the folder would NOT break it, reasoning "the packages aren't directory specific". Vocabulary met: pwd, cd, mv, `..`, Ctrl+C.

## vite
- status: introduced
- depends-on: npm-packages
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Told what Vite is (translates React into what browsers understand + dev server). Ran `npm create vite@latest client -- --template react` themselves. Predicted the scaffold would yield an immediately-working app — correct, but for a reason they hadn't accounted for (Vite 8 auto-installs and starts; older versions require a separate `npm install`). Has not yet opened the app or seen its files — tour due in task 1.3.

## npm-packages
- status: practicing
- depends-on: nodejs
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Read package.json unaided and explained the 2-vs-105 gap in own words: "i might only use 2 in the program (react and react-dom) but they are dependant on all 105". Shown dependencies vs devDependencies and package-lock.json as the exact-version recipe; not yet checked back.

## linting
- status: introduced
- depends-on: npm-packages
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Hit the scaffolder's oxlint/ESLint prompt and stopped to ask rather than guessing. Told what a linter is (reads code without running it, flags mistakes); chose ESLint on the "boring, widely-used choice" rationale. Has not yet run or configured it.

## project-structure
- status: introduced
- depends-on: none
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Asked why a backend needs its own folder, answered "it'll be easier to differentiate between backend and frontend" — right instinct, partial reason; extended toward the real one (two separately-run, separately-deployed programs with their own packages and start commands). Locked in client/ + server/ layout.

## nodejs
- status: introduced
- depends-on: why-node-express
- introduced: 2026-07-31
- last-reviewed: 2026-07-31
- evidence: Told what Node is (runs JavaScript outside the browser) and that npm ships with it. Confirmed installed: Node v22.22.2, npm v10.9.7. Not yet used directly — full treatment due in section 3.
